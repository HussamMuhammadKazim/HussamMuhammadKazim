# 👋 Hey there! I'm Hussam Muhammad Kazim

🎓 I'm a 17-year-old aspiring **Machine Learning Engineer** on a mission to build smart solutions and meaningful technology.

🔍 Currently diving deep into the **Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng**, exploring the building blocks of ML algorithms and getting hands-on with real-world problems.

💻 I recently completed a project on **Brain Tumor Segmentation**, applying what I’ve learned in a practical, impactful way. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/HussamMuhammadKazim/brain-tumor-segmentation)!

🚀 I’m passionate about:
- 🤖 Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- 🧠 Computer Vision & Medical Imaging
- 📊 Data Science & Model Interpretability
- 🧪 Experimenting with AI tools and new tech

🌱 On my learning roadmap:
- 📚 Deep Learning Specialization (coming up next!)
- 🛠 Building small ML projects and case studies
- 💡 Launching open-source tools for learners like me
- 🧩 Participating in Kaggle competitions (soon!)

📺 I’m also planning to launch a YouTube channel — **LearnWithHussam (LWH)** — where I’ll be sharing tutorials, projects, and my journey into the world of AI. Stay tuned!
